##Title of project: 
Development of a Severity Scoring System for Intermediate/ Mild Zellweger Spectrum Disorder.

##Description of ZSD:
ZSDs are a group of rare, autosomal, recessive, multisystemic disorders; they all have a defect in peroxisome biogenesis.

##What is a peroxisome? 
Small, membrane encolsed organelle; involved in lipid and protein storage; self-replicates; involved in the production of H2O2; inactivates toxic substances; invovled in metabolism of nitrogenous bases and carbohydrates.
ZSD has a phenotypic continumm (gray-scale), that ranges from mild to severe.

##Purpose:
Lack of robust tools to assess disease severity causing limitations in quantifiable disease burden which translates into limited observations for potential treatments.

##Goal: 
Develop and validate a robust and quantitative severity scoring system for mild to intermediate ZSD.

##Biogenesis: 
Peroxisome assembly involves proteins from 16 PEX genes; defects in 14 of these PEX genes causes PBD.
Peroxisomal B-oxidation is important in the metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) >22C
