# MICM-ZSD-Spectrum
Notes (12/05/2021)
Excel graph has multiple disease domains to represent systemic affects of ZSD.
Overview of disease: Mutations in 13 PEX genes:
PEX1 causes 70% of mutations.
PEX6 causes 30% of mutations.
The goal is to move away from NALD and IRD and use a mild to severe gray scale.
For interemediate cases, hypotonia is usualy seen first.
PEX1,6,26 are all associated with vision loss and hearing loss.
The overall goal is to use this robust quantification scale for monitoring disease progressment and to have a score to quanitfy disease burden.
This study has 140 patients which is the largest cohort yet.
Possibly going down the machine learning route vs biostatistical method could be interesting and more robust for this project.
