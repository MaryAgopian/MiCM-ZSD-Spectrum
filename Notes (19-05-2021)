Notes (19/05/2021)
Building severity score
Leukodystrophy is not documented in all the medical cases, so removing them might be a challenge.
Possible methodology: Since there are 50 well documented cases of leukodystrophy, can we use those cases as a subset to map out common symptom development that can point to leukodystrophy and remove all patients before the onset of leukodystrophy?
Problem: This might be too convoluted and relies on a small sample of patients, which might make it not reliable.
[Following meeting]
The first initiative for this project is cleaning up the dataset.
This involves standardising the units; as well as simplifying any extraneous notes.
The extraneous notes need to be cleaned up because the automated analysis is reliant on keywords.
possibly also might need to start with biostatistics instead of machine learning to have an idea of the range for mild and intermediate.
