Notes on MixEHR Paper (17-05-2021)
Paper title: Inferring multimodal latent topics from EHRs [*EHR = Electronic Health Records]
To address the specific challenges that come from EHRs being the dataset, the paper uses MixEHR (a multi-view Bayesian topic model)
Goal of this paper:
Formulate a latent topic model over discrete data.
Method:
Considering each patient as a 'document'; considering each disease as a 'topic'.
Disease = recurent combinations of individual phenotypes.
Refined goal:
Identify meaningful disease topics and apply them to find the probability for each topic.
MixEHR is based on LDA (latent Dirichtet allocation)
Data cleaning involves (1) Tokenizing (2) Stopping (3) Stemming
Tokenizing: Converting each document to its atomic elements.
Stopping: Removing convoluted or meaningless words.
Stemming: Merging words equivalent in meaning.
